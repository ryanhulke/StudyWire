# Study App
The ultimate study tool.

- automatically create flashcards from your notes or from your online textbook (pdf)
- your flashcard schedule is handled for you (similar to Anki)
- all you have to do is open the app for a few minutes every day you can trust that the knowledge will be uploaded to your brain!

to test: `npm run tauri dev`

to create the desktop binary: `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 npm run tauri build`

### TODO
- unified "Create" tab with options to create flashcards from your notes/textbook or on any topic you want through a chat interface
